# inverto-v2
A feature-rich, completely external CS2 cheat written in c++

# Features
- ESP
- AimBot
- Visibility Check
- Triggerbot
- Anti Flashbang
- Configs
- & many more

If you want to have a feature added, open an issue

## Additional Info
The program ***never*** writes to the game's memory, it only reads from it.<br>
Currently, as CS2 has no Client Anticheat it is therefore ***100% undetectable***.<br>
The only reason you could be banned is if you get VACLive (but that would only be a short game ban :O).
