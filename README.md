# inverto-v2
A feature-rich, completely external CS2 cheat written in c++

# Install
To install follow these steps:
- download the [newest release](https://github.com/devskiddlee/inverto-v2/releases/tag/v2.1)
- unpack anywhere (make sure the "assets" folder is in the same folder as "inverto.exe")
- start "inverto.exe"

# Features
- ESP

- Triggerbot
- Anti Flashbang
- Configs
- Themes
- Auto Offset Updater
- Player profiles
- & many more

If you want to have a feature added, go to #cheat-requests in the dc!

### Currently working on:
- nothing, give me ideas :)

### Planned:
- Wallbang Calculations
- ~~More Rage features (e.g. auto shoot on vis)~~ âœ…

## Additional Info
The program ***never*** writes to the game's memory, it only reads from it.<br>
Currently, as CS2 has no Client Anticheat it is therefore ***100% undetectable***.<br>
The only reason you could be banned is if you get VACLive (but that would only be a short game ban :O).<br>
It uses [a2x's dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/) for the offsets.

### Stats for my setup (i7-9700 & GTX 1660 Super):
- ~1.00ms per tick  (~1000 ticks  per second)
- ~1.58ms per frame (~630  frames per second)
